# TuxHack v1.2 Decompiled & Remapped

## Not sure what this is...
Probably a Vulcan skid by the looks of it. 


Very bad client, seriously when will someone give me a good client to work with FFS.

Anyways, decompiled and remapped for fun, no, I will not offer support for it. 

Go to the releases jar to download the release jar.
